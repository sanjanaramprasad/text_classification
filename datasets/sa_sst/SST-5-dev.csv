157,half submarine flick half ghost story all in one criminally neglected film,2
158,the x potion gives the quickly named blossom bubbles and buttercup supernatural powers that include extraordinary strength and laserbeam eyes which unfortunately do nt enable them to discern flimsy screenplays,1
159,my wife is an actress is an utterly charming french comedy that feels so american in sensibility and style it is virtually its own hollywood remake,4
160,an overemphatic wouldbe wacky ultimately tedious sex farce,1
161,but daphne you are too buff fred thinks he is tough and velma wow you have lost weight,1

177,a deep and meaningful film,4
178,sit through this one and you wo nt need a magic watch to stop time your dvd player will do it for you,1
179,holden caulfield did it better,1
180,the action switches between past and present but the material link is too tenuous to anchor the emotional connections that purport to span a 125year divide,1
181,samira makhmalbaf s new film blackboards is much like the ethos of a stream of consciousness although it is unfortunate for the viewer that the thoughts and reflections coming through are torpid and banal,0

190,you wo nt miss its messages but you will be entertained as well,2
191,for movie lovers as well as opera lovers tosca is a real treat,4
192,the inspirational screenplay by mike rich covers a lot of ground perhaps too much but ties things together neatly by the end,3
193,the film s performances are thrilling,4
194,a fitfully amusing romp that if nothing else will appeal to fans of malcolm in the middle and its pubescent star frankie muniz,3

200,holm embodies the character with an effortlessly regal charisma,4
201,lrb ns rrb directed the stage version of elling and gets fine performances from his two leads who originated the characters on stage,4
202,my big fat greek wedding uses stereotypes in a delightful blend of sweet romance and lovingly dished out humor,4
203,if director michael dowse only superficially understands his characters he does nt hold them in contempt,1
204,this rather superficial arthouse middlebrow film knows how to please a crowd and that is about all it does well,2
205,whaley s determination to immerse you in sheer unrelenting wretchedness is exhausting,0
206,with an emotional sterility to match its outer space setting soderbergh s spectacular swing for the fence yields only a spectacular whiff,2
207,at its best queen is campy fun like the vincent price horror classics of the 60s,3
208,moretti s compelling anatomy of grief and the difficult process of adapting to loss,1

212,an artful intelligent film that stays within the confines of a wellestablished genre,4
213,makes for a pretty unpleasant viewing experience,0
214,pretension in its own way is a form of bravery,2
215,travels a fascinating arc from hope and euphoria to reality and disillusionment,3
216,like the chelsea s denizens burdette s collageform scenario tends to overromanticize the spiritual desolation of the struggling artiste,2
217,altogether this is successful as a film while at the same time being a most touching reconsideration of the familiar masterpiece,4
218,an otherwise intense twistandturn thriller that certainly should nt hurt talented young gaghan s resume,3

226,a rewarding work of art for only the most patient and challengehungry moviegoers,3
227,due to some script weaknesses and the casting of the director s brother the film trails off into inconsequentiality,1

241,it is a scathing portrayal,2
242,the movie achieves as great an impact by keeping these thoughts hidden as lrb quills rrb did by showing them,3
243,the film s welcome breeziness and some unbelievably hilarious moments most portraying the idiocy of the film industry make it mostly worth the trip,4

249,the film s tone and pacing are off almost from the getgo,1
250,the cold turkey would have been a far better title,1
