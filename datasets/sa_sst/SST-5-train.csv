1,apparently reassembled from the cuttingroom floor of any given daytime soap,1
2,they presume their audience wo nt sit still for a sociology lesson however entertainingly presented so they trot out the conventional sciencefiction elements of bugeyed monsters and futuristic women in skimpy clothes,1
3,the entire movie is filled with deja vu moments,2
4,this is a visually stunning rumination on love memory history and the war between art and commerce,3
5,um no,2
6,jonathan parker s bartleby should have been the beallendall of the modernoffice anomie films,3
7,campanella gets the tone just right funny in the middle of sad in the middle of hopeful,3
8,a fan film that for the uninitiated plays better on video with the sound turned down,1
9,bart and berling are both superb while huppert is magnificent,4
10,a little less extreme than in the past with longer exposition sequences between them and with fewer gags to break the tedium,1
11,the film is strictly routine,1
12,a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal selfdiscovery and a picaresque view of a littleremembered world,3

14,for something as splendidlooking as this particular film the viewer expects something special but instead gets lrb scifi rrb rehash,1
15,this is a stunning film a oneofakind tour de force,4
16,may be more genial than ingenious but it gets the job done,3
17,there is a freedom to watching stunts that are this crude this fastpaced and this insane,3
18,if the tuxedo actually were a suit it would fit chan like a 99 bargainbasement special,1
19,as quiet patient and tenacious as mr lopez himself who approaches his difficult endless work with remarkable serenity and discipline,4
20,final verdict you have seen it all before,0
21,blue crush follows the formula but throws in too many conflicts to keep the story compelling,1
22,you get a sense of good intentions derailed by a failure to seek and strike just the right tone,1
23,a slick engrossing melodrama,4
24,a wretched movie that reduces the second world war to one man s quest to find an old flame,1
25,eccentric enough to stave off doldrums caruso as selfconscious debut is also eminently forgettable,2
26,will undoubtedly play well in european markets where mr besson is a brand name and in asia where ms shu is an institution but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic,1
27,one of lrb jaglom s rrb better efforts a wry and sometime bitter movie about love,2
28,lacks the inspiration of the original and has a bloated plot that stretches the running time about 10 minutes past a child s interest and an adult s patience,0
29,the santa clause 2 proves itself a more streamlined and thought out encounter than the original could ever have hoped to be,3
30,the film is moody oozing chilling and heartwarming all at once a twisting unpredictable catandmouse thriller,4
31,too bad,1

33,gooding offers a desperately ingratiating performance,1
34,you end up simply admiring this bit or that this performance or that,2
35,a wellintentioned effort that is still too burdened by the actor s offbeat sensibilities for the earnest emotional core to emerge with any degree of accessibility,1
36,analyze that regurgitates and waters down many of the previous film s successes with a few new swings thrown in,2
37,there is a neat twist subtly rendered that could have wrapped things up at 80 minutes but kang tacks on three or four more endings,2

44,ottosallies has a real filmmaker s eye,3
45,lurid and less than lucid work,1
46,a portrait of an artist,2

53,you live the mood rather than savour the story,3
54,the movie is so thoughtlessly assembled,3
55,here polanski looks back on those places he saw at childhood and captures them by freeing them from artefact and by showing them heartbreakingly drably,2
56,some body is a shaky uncertain film that nevertheless touches a few raw nerves,3
57,it is a very sincere work but it would be better as a diary or documentary,3
58,while american adobo has its heart lrb and its palate rrb in the right place its brain is a little scattered ditsy even,1
59,unfolds with such a wallop of youarethere immediacy that when the bullets start to fly your first instinct is to duck,4

61,it is not too fast and not too slow,3
62,it is an entertaining movie and the effects boosted to the size of a downtown hotel will all but take you to outer space,3
63,it is as uncompromising as it is nonjudgmental and makes clear that a prostitute can be as lonely and needy as any of the clients,3
64,compellingly watchable,4
65,despite some comic sparks welcome to collinwood never catches fire,1
66,he may have meant the internet short saving ryan s privates,2
67,though jackson does nt always succeed in integrating the characters in the foreground into the extraordinarily rich landscape it must be said that he is an imaginative filmmaker who can see the forest for the trees,3

74,poignant if familiar story of a young person suspended between two cultures,3
75,a perfectly acceptable perfectly bland competently acted but by no means scary horror movie,2
76,methodical measured and gently tedious in its comedy secret ballot is a purposefully reductive movie which may be why it is so successful at lodging itself in the brain,4
77,this is amusing for about three minutes,2
78,though a touch too arthouse 101 in its poetic symbolism heaven proves to be a good match of the sensibilities of two directors,3
79,superbly photographed and staged by mendes with a series of riveting set pieces the likes of which mainstream audiences have rarely seen,4
80,a metaphor for a modernday urban china searching for its identity,3
81,it is a square sentimental drama that satisfies as comfort food often can,3
82,the wonderfully lush morvern callar is pure punk existentialism and ms ramsay and her cowriter liana dognini have dramatized the alan warner novel which itself felt like an answer to irvine welsh s book trainspotting,3
83,admirers of director abel ferrara may be relieved that his latest feature r xmas marks a modest if encouraging return to form,4
84,not once in the rush to save the day did i become very involved in the proceedings to me it was just a matter of eh,1
85,an uglyduckling tale so hideously and clumsily told it feels accidental,0
86,becomes a bit of a mishmash a tearjerker that does nt and a thriller that wo nt,0
87,at its worst the movie is pretty diverting the pity is that it rarely achieves its best,2
88,could i have been more geeked when i heard that apollo 13 was going to be released in imax format,4

90,more successful at relating history than in creating an emotionally complex dramatically satisfying heroine,1
91,cho s timing is priceless,4
92,criminal conspiracies and true romances move so easily across racial and cultural lines in the film that it makes my big fat greek wedding look like an apartheid drama,3

94,what elevates the movie above the runofthemill singles blender is its surreal sense of humor and technological finish,4
95,greengrass lrb working from don mullan s script rrb forgoes the larger sociopolitical picture of the situation in northern ireland in favour of an approach that throws one in the pulsating thick of a truly frightening situation,2
96,nicholson s understated performance is wonderful,4
97,the filmmakers know how to please the eye but it is not always the prettiest pictures that tell the best story,3
98,it is unfortunate that wallace who wrote gibson s braveheart as well as the recent pearl harbor has such an irrepressible passion for sappy situations and dialogue,1
99,jackson shamefully strolls through this mess with a smug grin inexplicably wearing a kilt and carrying a bag of golf clubs over one shoulder,1
100,jackson tries to keep the plates spinning as best he can but all the bouncing back and forth ca nt help but become a bit tedious even with the breathtaking landscapes and villainous varmints there to distract you from the ricocheting,2
101,a fascinating curiosity piece fascinating that is for about ten minutes,1

108,isabelle huppert excels as the enigmatic mika and anna mouglalis is a stunning new young talent in one of chabrol s most intense psychological mysteries,4

111,perhaps the best sports movie i have ever seen,4
112,this pathetic junk is barely an hour long,0

117,it treats ana s journey with honesty that is tragically rare in the depiction of young women in film,3
118,leigh makes these lives count,3
119,igby goes down is one of those movies,2
120,ambitious unsettling psychodrama that takes full chilling advantage of its rougharoundtheedges lowbudget constraints,3
121,the woodman seems to have directly influenced this girlmeetsgirl love story but even more reassuring is how its makers actually seem to understand what made allen s romantic comedies so pertinent and enduring,3
122,i could nt recommend this film more,3
123,an inexperienced director mehta has much to learn,1
124,you can taste it but there is no fizz,1
125,a reworking of die hard and cliffhanger but it is nowhere near as exciting as either,1
126,a moving tale of love and destruction in unexpected places unexamined lives,3
127,it has more than a few moments that are insightful enough to be fondly remembered in the endlessly challenging maze of moviegoing,3

132,sandra bullock despite downplaying her good looks carries a little too much ai nt shecute baggage into her lead role as a troubled and determined homicide cop to quite pull off the heavy stuff,1
133,it is mostly a pleasure to watch,3
134,a bit too derivative to stand on its own as the psychological thriller it purports to be,2
135,its spirit of iconoclastic abandon however canned makes for unexpectedly giddy viewing,3
136,a kilted jackson is an unsettling sight and indicative of his if you will outofkilter character who rambles aimlessly through illconceived action pieces,1
137,i did nt find much fascination in the swinging,1
138,this is no waterboy,1
139,but the nerveraked acting the crackle of lines the impressive stagings of hardware make for some robust and scary entertainment,4

141,babyfaced renner is eerily convincing as this bland blank of a man with unimaginable demons within,3

146,the irwins scenes are fascinating the movie as a whole is cheap junk and an insult to their deathdefying efforts,0
147,it is a frightful vanity film that no doubt pays off what debt miramax felt they owed to benigni,0
148,he seems to want both but succeeds in making neither,1
149,funny though,2
150,by turns fanciful grisly and engagingly quixotic,3
151,the rerelease of ron howard s apollo 13 in the imax format proves absolutely that really really really good things can come in enormous packages,3
152,unofficially national lampoon s van wilder is son of animal house,2

5943,it is a film with an idea buried somewhere inside its fabric but never clearly seen or felt,1
5944,one can only assume that the jury who bestowed star hoffman s brother gordy with the waldo salt screenwriting award at 2002 s sundance festival were honoring an attempt to do something different over actually pulling it off,1
5945,seeks to transcend its genre with a curiously stylized quasishakespearean portrait of pure misogynist evil,3
5946,not a stereotype is omitted nor a clich left unsaid,1
5947,a smart steamy mix of road movie comingofage story and political satire,3
5948,it is coherent well shot and tartly acted but it wears you down like a dinner guest showing off his doctorate,1
5949,wraps itself in the guise of a dark and quirky comedy but it is nt as quirky as it thinks it is and its comedy is generally meanspirited,2
5950,k19 will not go down in the annals of cinema as one of the great submarine stories but it is an engaging and exciting narrative of man confronting the demons of his own fear and paranoia,3
5951,a four star performance from kevin kline who unfortunately works with a two star script,3
5952,god bless crudup and his aversion to taking the easy hollywood road and cashing in on his moviestar gorgeousness,3
5953,it is a feelgood movie about which you can actually feel good,4
5954,the movie is our story as much as it is schmidt s no matter if it is viewed as a selfreflection or cautionary tale,2
5955,if anything see it for karen black who camps up a storm as a fringe feminist conspiracy theorist named dirty dick,3
5956,watching the chemistry between freeman and judd however almost makes this movie worth seeing,3
5957,mark wahlberg may look classy in a 60s homage pokepie hat but as a character he is dry dry dry,2
5958,a film that will probably please people already fascinated by behan but leave everyone else yawning with admiration,2
5959,moonlight mile gives itself the freedom to feel contradictory things,3
5960,it is a movie that accomplishes so much that one viewing ca nt possibly be enough,3
5961,the film aims to be funny uplifting and moving sometimes all at once,3
5962,like being trapped inside a huge video game where exciting inane images keep popping past your head and the same illogical things keep happening over and over again,2
5963,the film never gets over its own investment in conventional arrangements in terms of love age gender race and class,1
5964,nicely combines the enigmatic features of memento with the hallucinatory drug culture of requiem for a dream,3
5965,last dance whatever its flaws fulfills one facet of its mission in making me want to find out whether in this case that is true,2
5966,sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours,1
5967,lrb a rrb stale retread of the 53 original,1
5968,more concerned with overall feelings broader ideas and openended questions than concrete story and definitive answers soderbergh s solaris is a gorgeous and deceptively minimalist cinematic tone poem,4
5969,alarms for duvall s throbbing sincerity and his elderly propensity for patting people while he talks,3
5970,there is no point in extracting the bare bones of byatt s plot for purposes of bland hollywood romance,1
5971,the performances are amiable and committed and the comedy more often than not hits the bullseye,3
5972,zigzag might have been richer and more observant if it were less densely plotted,1
5973,to better understand why this did nt connect with me would require another viewing and i wo nt be sitting through this one again that in itself is commentary enough,0
5974,is a question for philosophers not filmmakers all the filmmakers need to do is engage an audience,1
5975,at some point all this visual trickery stops being clever and devolves into flashy vaguely silly overkill,1
5976,a ragbag of cliches,0
5977,overburdened with complicated plotting and banal dialogue,1
5978,the picture runs a mere 84 minutes but it is no glance,3
5979,steers refreshingly clear of the usual cliches,3
5980,niccol the filmmaker merges his collaborators symbolic images with his words insinuating for example that in hollywood only god speaks to the press,3
5981,it is a beautiful film full of elaborate and twisted characters and it is also pretty funny,4
5982,the milieu is wholly unconvincing and the histrionics reach a truly annoying pitch,1
5983,the picture emerges as a surprisingly anemic disappointment,0
5984,whatever complaints i might have i would take lrb its rrb earnest errors and hardwon rewards over the bombastic selfglorification of other feelgood fiascos like antwone fisher or the emperor s club any time,3
5985,rice never clearly defines his characters or gives us a reason to care about them,1
5986,though not for everyone the guys is a somber trip worth taking,2
5987,another entertaining romp from robert rodriguez,3
5988,but here s a movie about it anyway,1
5989,if lrb jaglom s rrb latest effort is not the director at his most sparkling some of its repartee is still worth hearing,3
5990,i did nt smile,1
5991,the script by david koepp is perfectly serviceable and because he gives the story some soul he elevates the experience to a more mythic level,4
5992,kapur fails to give his audience a single character worth rooting for lrb or worth rooting against for that matter rrb,1
5993,it is a visual delight and a decent popcorn adventure as long as you do nt try to look too deep into the story,3
5994,see it now before the inevitable hollywood remake flattens out all its odd intriguing wrinkles,2
5995,befuddled in its characterizations as it begins to seem as long as the two year affair which is its subject,1
5996,nothing more than an amiable but unfocused bagatelle that plays like a looselyconnected string of actingworkshop exercises,0
5997,it is horribly depressing and not very well done,0
5998,veterans of the dating wars will smirk uneasily at the film s nightmare versions of everyday sexinthecity misadventures,2
5999,now as a former gong show addict i will admit it my only complaint is that we did nt get more recreations of all those famous moments from the show,3
6000,ryosuke has created a wry winning if languidly paced meditation on the meaning and value of family,2
6001,enough may pander to our basest desires for payback but unlike many revenge fantasies it ultimately delivers,3
6002,i prefer soderbergh s concentration on his two lovers over tarkovsky s mostly male mostly patriarchal debating societies,2
6003,this is cruel misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy,1
6004,a pale xerox of other better crime movies,1
6005,strange it is but delightfully so,3
6006,the story has little wit and no surprises,1
6007,crummy,0
6008,just another disjointed fairly predictable psychological thriller,0
6009,this is a very funny heartwarming film,4
6010,rare birds tries to force its quirkiness upon the audience,2
6011,goodnaturedly cornball sequel,3
6012,the tone errs on the shrill side tempered by a soft southern gentility that speaks of beauty grace and a closet full of skeletons,2
6013,the french director has turned out nearly 212 hours of unfocused excruciatingly tedious cinema that half an hour in starts making water torture seem appealing,0
6014,it is only in fairy tales that princesses that are married for political reason live happily ever after,1
6015,feardotcom s thrills are all cheap but they mostly work,2
6016,a static and sugary little halfhour afterschool special about interfaith understanding stretched out to 90 minutes,2
6017,a small movie with a big impact,4
6018,the sort of picture in which whenever one of the characters has some serious soul searching to do they go to a pictureperfect beach during sunset,1
6019,crammed with incident and bristles with passion and energy,3
6020,an intelligent and deeply felt work about impossible irrevocable choices and the price of making them,4
6021,lrb gosling s rrb combination of explosive physical energy and convincing intelligence helps create a complex unpredictable character,3
6022,and it sees those relationships including that between the son and his wife and the wife and the father and between the two brothers with incredible subtlety and acumen,3
6023,though it inspires some lrb outoffield rrb creative thought the film is to its own detriment much more a cinematic collage than a polemical tract,2
6024,in the new guy even the bull gets recycled,1
6025,reggio and glass so rhapsodize cynicism with repetition and languorous slomo sequences that glass s dirgelike score becomes a fangbaring lullaby,1
6026,marshall puts a suspenseful spin on standard horror flick formula,3
6027,there might be some sort of credible genderprovoking philosophy submerged here but who the hell cares,1
6028,a movie that is held captive by mediocrity,1
6029,screenwriter chris ver weil s directing debut is goodnatured and never dull but its virtues are small and easily overshadowed by its predictability,2
6030,an admirable sometimes exceptional film,4
6031,this is a film that manages to find greatness in the hue of its drastic iconography,3
6032,a whole lot of fun and funny in the middle though somewhat less hardhitting at the start and finish,3
6033,spiced with humor lrb i speak fluent flatula advises denlopp after a rather er bubbly exchange with an alien deckhand rrb and witty updatings lrb silver s parrot has been replaced with morph a cute alien creature who mimics everyone and everything around rrb,3
6034,has a customarily jovial air but a deficit of flimflam inventiveness,1
6035,not all of the stories work and the ones that do are thin and scattered but the film works well enough to make it worth watching,3
6036,a strangely stirring experience that finds warmth in the coldest environment and makes each crumb of emotional comfort feel like a 10course banquet,4
6037,matthew lillard is born to play shaggy,4
6038,a darkaspitch comedy that frequently veers into corny sentimentality probably would not improve much after a therapeutic zap of shock treatment,1
6039,there is lots of cool stuff packed into espn s ultimate x,3
6040,the mothman prophecies is best when illustrating the demons bedevilling the modern masculine journey,3
6041,at its best it is black hawk down with more heart,3
6042,home movie is the film equivalent of a lovingly rendered coffee table book,2
6043,invigorating surreal and resonant with a rainbow of emotion,4
6044,a tired unimaginative and derivative variation of that alreadyshallow genre,1
6045,patchy combination of soap opera lowtech magic realism and at times ploddingly sociological commentary,1
6046,a frustrating yet deeply watchable melodrama that makes you think it is a tougher picture than it is,2
6047,a solid cast assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony,3
6048,rodriguez has the chops of a smartaleck film school brat and the imagination of a big kid,3
6049,arnie blows things up,2
6050,if you are really renting this you are not interested in discretion in your entertainment choices you are interested in anne geddes john grisham and thomas kincaid,2
6051,a movie you observe rather than one you enter into,1
6052,should have been worth cheering as a breakthrough but is devoid of wit and humor,1
6053,lrb barry rrb gives assassin a disquieting authority,3
6054,its plot and animation offer daytime tv serviceability but little more,1
6055,a moving and important film,4
6056,these people are really going to love the piano teacher,4
6057,a disappointment for a movie that should have been the ultimate imax trip,1
6058,a portrait of alienation so perfect it will certainly succeed in alienating most viewers,1
6059,yes but also intriguing and honorable a worthwhile addition to a distinguished film legacy,3
6060,cremaster 3 should come with the warning for serious film buffs only,3
6061,this big screen caper has a good bark far from being a bowwow,2
6062,what is most refreshing about real women have curves is its unforced comedydrama and its relaxed naturalseeming actors,3
6063,surprisingly insightful,3
6064,to those who have not read the book the film is a much better motherdaughter tale than last summer s divine secrets of the yaya sisterhood but that is not saying much,3
6065,the director with his fake backdrops and stately pacing never settles on a consistent tone,0
6066,earnest yet curiously tepid and choppy recycling in which predictability is the only winner,1
6067,brash intelligent and erotically perplexing haneke s portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt,4
6068,a glorious mess,2
6069,unfortunately contrived plotting stereotyped characters and woo s overthetop instincts as a director undermine the moral dilemma at the movie s heart,2
6070,arguably the best script that besson has written in years,4
6071,it is most of the things costner movies are known for it is sanctimonious selfrighteous and so eager to earn our love that you want to slap it,1
6072,pretend it is a werewolf itself by avoiding eye contact and walking slowly away,1
6073,you can fire a torpedo through some of clancy s holes and the scripters do nt deserve any oscars,0

6077,each scene drags underscoring the obvious and sentiment is slathered on top,1
6078,fluffy neonoir hiding behind cutesy film references,1
6079,a special kind of movie this melancholic film noir reminded me a lot of memento,4
6080,do nt expect any subtlety from this latest entry in the increasingly threadbare grossout comedy cycle,2
6081,one of the most genuinely sweet films to come along in quite some time,4
6082,a film really has to be exceptional to justify a three hour running time and this is nt,1
6083,too ordinary to restore lrb harmon rrb to prominence despite some creepy scenes that evoke childish night terrors and a praiseworthy attempt to generate suspense rather than gross out the audience,2
6084,highly watchable stuff,4
6085,exceptionally well acted by diane lane and richard gere,4
6086,there is no real reason to see it and no real reason not to,2
6087,content merely to lionize its title character and exploit his anger all for easy sanctimony formulaic thrills and a hamfisted sermon on the need for national health insurance,1
6088,a charming but slight comedy,3
6089,you know that ten bucks you would spend on a ticket,2
6090,everything else about high crimes is like the military system of justice it portrays tiresomely regimented,2
6091,an unusually dryeyed even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture,3
6092,a beyondlame satire teddy bears picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writeractor,1
6093,it looks like an action movie but it is so poorly made on all levels that it does nt even qualify as a spoof of such,0
6094,takes one character we do nt like and another we do nt believe and puts them into a battle of wills that is impossible to care about and is nt very funny,2
6095,but mostly it is a work that with humor warmth and intelligence captures a life interestingly lived,4
6096,as an introduction to the man s theories and influence derrida is all but useless as a portrait of the artist as an endlessly inquisitive old man however it is invaluable,3
6097,young hanks and fisk who vaguely resemble their celebrity parents bring fresh good looks and an ease in front of the camera to the work,4
6098,excellent performances from jacqueline bisset and martha plimpton grace this deeply touching melodrama,4
6099,the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back,3
6100,its generic villains lack any intrigue lrb other than their funny accents rrb and the action scenes are poorly delivered,1

6105,in a movie full of surprises the biggest is that secret ballot is a comedy both gentle and biting,3
6106,passable enough for a shootout in the ok court house of life type of flick,2
6107,deep down i realized the harsh reality of my situation i would leave the theater with a lower iq than when i had entered,0
6108,a chance to see three splendid actors turn a larky chase movie into an emotionally satisfying exploration of the very human need to be somebody and to belong to somebody,4
6109,well cast and well directed a powerful drama with enough sardonic wit to keep it from being maudlin,4
6110,an ambitiously naturalistic albeit halfbaked drama about an abused innercity autistic teen,3
6111,it is just too bad the film s story does not live up to its style,1
6112,just how these families interact may surprise you,2
6113,a wild ride juiced with enough energy and excitement for at least three films,3

6118,the cat s meow marks a return to form for director peter bogdanovich,3

6127,hope keeps arising that the movie will live up to the apparent skills of its makers and the talents of its actors but it does nt,2
6128,barney throws away the goodwill the first half of his movie generates by orchestrating a finale that is impenetrable and dull,1
6129,an indispensable peek at the art and the agony of making people laugh,3
6130,at 78 minutes it just zings along with vibrance and warmth,4
6131,the film while not exactly assured in its execution is notable for its sheer audacity and openness,3
6132,dull and mechanical kinda like a very goofy museum exhibit,2
6133,it is sweet and fluffy at the time but it may leave you feeling a little sticky and unsatisfied,1
6134,sayles has an eye for the ways people of different ethnicities talk to and about others outside the group,3
6135,brady achieves the remarkable feat of squandering a topnotch foursome of actors by shoving them into every clichd whitetrash situation imaginable,2
6136,the irony is that this film s cast is uniformly superb their performances could have should have been allowed to stand on their own,3
6137,this slowmoving swedish film offers not even a hint of joy preferring to focus on the humiliation of martin as he defecates in bed and urinates on the plants at his own birthday party,2
6138,i admire the closing scenes of the film which seem to ask whether our civilization offers a cure for vincent s complaint,3
6139,a dreary movie,0

6145,the emotional overload of female angst irreparably drags the film down,0
6146,there is undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references but the fun wears thin then out when there is nothing else happening,3
6147,an engrossing and grim portrait of hookers what they think of themselves and their clients,4
6148,like mike is a harmlessly nave slice of bball fantasy fit for filling in during the real nba s offseason,2
6149,a lovely and beautifully photographed romance,3
6150,in the end all you can do is admire the ensemble players and wonder what the point of it is,2
6151,while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture the journey does nt really go anywhere,1
6152,the film s messages of tolerance and diversity are nt particularly original but one ca nt help but be drawn in by the sympathetic characters,3
6153,aside from the fact that the film idiotically uses the website feardotcomcom or the improperly hammy performance from poor stephen rea the film gets added disdain for the fact that it is nearly impossible to look at or understand,0

6158,aniston has at last decisively broken with her friends image in an independent film of satiric fire and emotional turmoil,3
6159,blade ii is still topheavy with blazing guns cheatfully filmed martial arts disintegrating bloodsucker computer effects and jagged camera moves that serve no other purpose than to call attention to themselves,0
6160,every joke is repeated at least four times,1
6161,a smart and funny albeit sometimes superficial cautionary tale of a technology in search of an artist,3
6162,if you like an extreme actionpacked film with a hint of humor then triple x marks the spot,3
6163,otherwise maybe,2
6164,stanley kwan has directed not only one of the best gay love stories ever made but one of the best love stories of any stripe,4
6165,just about the best straightup oldschool horror film of the last 15 years,4
6166,please see previous answer,2
6167,in the director s cut the film is not only a love song to the movies but it also is more fully an example of the kind of lush allenveloping movie experience it rhapsodizes,3
6168,not really as bad as you might think,2
6169,samuel l jackson is one of the best actors there is,4
6170,it does give a taste of the burning man ethos an appealing blend of countercultural idealism and hedonistic creativity,3
6171,a plethora of engaging diatribes on the meaning of home delivered in grand passion by the members of the various households,3
6172,the result is good gossip entertainingly delivered yet with a distinctly musty odour its expiry date long gone,2
6173,has some visual wit but little imagination elsewhere,2

6186,a terrific b movie in fact the best in recent memory,4
6187,unfortunately the experience of actually watching the movie is less compelling than the circumstances of its making,0
6188,i liked about schmidt a lot but i have a feeling that i would have liked it much more if harry tonto never existed,3

6191,nobody seems to have cared much about any aspect of it from its cheesy screenplay to the grayish quality of its lighting to its lastminute haphazard theatrical release,0
6192,as in aimless arduous and arbitrary,1
6193,aside from rohmer s bold choices regarding point of view the lady and the duke represents the filmmaker s lifelong concern with formalist experimentation in cinematic art,3
6194,a fascinating glimpse into an insular world that gives the lie to many clichs and showcases a group of dedicated artists,4
6195,this is a poster movie a mediocre tribute to films like them,1
6196,there is no solace here no entertainment value merely a fierce lesson in where filmmaking can take us,1
6197,the graphic carnage and recreation of wartorn croatia is uncomfortably timely relevant and sickeningly real,3
6198,the ingenious construction lrb adapted by david hare from michael cunningham s novel rrb constantly flows forwards and back weaving themes among three strands which allow us to view events as if through a prism,3

6215,this scifi technosex thriller starts out bizarre and just keeps getting weirder,2
6216,close enough in spirit to its freewheeling trashcinema roots to be a breath of fresh air,3
6217,a dreary indulgence,2
6218,teens only,2
6219,while the transgressive trappings lrb especially the frank sex scenes rrb ensure that the film is never dull rodrigues s beastwithin metaphor is ultimately rather silly and overwrought making the ambiguous ending seem goofy rather than provocative,1
6220,blue crush has all the trappings of an energetic extremesports adventure but ends up more of a creaky pretty woman retread with the emphasis on selfempowering schmaltz and bigwave surfing that gives pic its title an afterthought,1

6222,a man leaving the screening said the film was better than saving private ryan,4

6225,daring and beautifully made,4
6226,there has to be a few advantages to never growing old,2
6227,a wellcrafted film that is all the more remarkable because it achieves its emotional power and moments of revelation with restraint and a delicate ambiguity,3
6228,with three excellent principal singers a youthful and goodlooking diva and tenor and richly handsome locations it is enough to make you wish jacquot had left well enough alone and just filmed the opera without all these distortions of perspective,2

6943,the bard as black comedy willie would have loved it,4

6972,trailer trash cinema so uncool the only thing missing is the gadzooks,1

6975,more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are an amusing little catch,3
6976,i found the ring moderately absorbing largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound,3
6977,a graceful moving tribute to the courage of new york s finest and a nicely understated expression of the grief shared by the nation at their sacrifice,4
6978,and it is harder still to believe that anyone in his right mind would want to see the it,0
6979,contrived as this may sound mr rose s updating works surprisingly well,3

6986,one of the very best movies ever made about the life of moviemaking,4
6987,is many things stoner midnight flick scifi deconstruction gay fantasia but above all it is a love story as sanguine as its title,3

6997,smarter than its commercials make it seem,3
6998,a reasonably entertaining sequel to 1994 s surprise family hit that may strain adult credibility,3
6999,sinks into the usual cafeteria goulash of fart jokes masturbation jokes and racist japanese jokes,2

7008,apparently romantic comedy with a fresh point of view just does nt figure in the present hollywood program,0
7009,thanks to confident filmmaking and a pair of fascinating performances the way to that destination is a really special walk in the woods,4

7044,manages to be wholesome and subversive at the same time,3
7045,feels aimless for much of its running time until late in the film when a tidal wave of plot arrives leaving questions in its wake,1
7046,a few zingers aside the writing is indifferent and jordan brady s direction is prosaic,1
7047,the corpse count ultimately overrides what little we learn along the way about vicarious redemption,1
7048,finally coming down off of miramax s deep shelves after a couple of aborted attempts waking up in reno makes a strong case for letting sleeping dogs lie,2

7061,a latenight cable sexploitation romp masquerading as a thriller about the ruthless social order that governs college cliques,2
7062,this film puts wang at the forefront of china s sixth generation of film makers,4

7076,a timely look back at civil disobedience antiwar movements and the power of strong voices,3
